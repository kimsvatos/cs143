Project 2 - Part B

We believe that we have fully implemented all functionality for this part of the project. 

For keeping track of key count, we decided to store an integer in the first four bytes of 
every buffer. That way, these four bytes can be quickly read and accessed when calling
getKeyCount(), and we created an additioanl function updateKeyCount() to easily change
this value. 

For this part of the project, work was broken up as follows:

80% Together: general outlining, functions, structure
10% Kyle: additional Leaf functions and debugging, testing
10% Kim: additional non-leaf functions.
