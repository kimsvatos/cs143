Project 2 - Part A

We believe that we have fully implemented all functionality for this part of the project. The code for reading the load file and creating the table file is all located in the 'load' function, as required by the spec. The only functionality that remains to be implemented for the 'load' function is the creation of an index for option 'WITH INDEX', but this functionality is to be implemented in a later iteration of the project.

For this part of the project, we worked entirely together, at the same time.
