Project 1C CS 143

Kyle Haacker and Kim Svatos


For this project we implemented all features and requirements of the spec. 


We worked on the project exclusively when we were together with the work-flow being split
up as Kim mostly wrote code with Kyle's input, while Kyle would test and debug, or 
research additional PHP functions we might find useful. 

Kyle did the majority of the coding for the CSS, while Kim contributed smaller 
portions to the CSS.
